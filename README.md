## How to Start
Just press any button to start. You then choose the different letters of the alphabet and try to figure out Who's That Pokemon.
You will have a set number of misses and you have to figure out the pokemon within those misses or you lose.

The hidden name will be shown as underlined spaces and the number of underlined spaces show the length of the name. 

Press any letter key to guess at the hidden Pokemon. The guessed letter will appear on the screen. If the guessed letter is not in the hidden name, the nummber of allowable misses will decrease.

If the number reaches 0, you lose. If you are able to find all of the letters hidden in the Pokemon name, you win. The next hidden Pokemon will appear the next time you press a key.


### Aim to be a Pokemon Master!
